## Controlling the interface

### Opening Omni

To open Omni, simply press `‚åò+K` on Mac or `Ctrl+K` on Windows. You can change the shortcut by going to chrome://extensions/shortcuts.

Alternatively you can click on the extension icon in the toolbar to toggle it.

### Closing Omni

To close Omni you can press `Esc`, click on the background, or press the extension icon.

### Switching between dark and light mode

The dark and light theme in Omni is tied to your system's theme.

On Mac you can change the theme by clicking on the Apple menu (on the top left), opening the System preferences, going into the General section, and then choosing between dark, light, or auto.

On Windows it depends on the OS version. [Here is a guide for Windows 11 and 10.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6#ID0EBF=Windows_11)

After switching the theme you might need to restart Chrome.

## Self-hosting Omni
You can run Omni locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:

1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP".
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the [src folder](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni/tree/master/src) (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you will now be able to use Omni locally.

## Libraries used
